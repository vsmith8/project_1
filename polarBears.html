      <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Polar bears are linked to the Arctic sea ice</li>
          <li>The bears are found in five range states:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The U.S. (Alaska), Canada, Russia, Greenland, and Norway (Svalbard).</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Polar bears donâ€™t have territories because their prey is always on the move</li>
        </ul>
     </div>

      <h2>Adaptations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Polar bears have 2 layers of fur that prevent almost all heat loss</li>
          <li>Polar bears have a thick layer of fat to keep them warm</li>
          <li>Their forepaws act like large paddles and their hind paws serve as rudders</li>
          <li>Papillae (on the bottom of their feet) grip the ice and keep the bear from slipping.</li>
